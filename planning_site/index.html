<!-- Overview -->
<hr>
<h1 id="o">Overview</h1>
<p>This python program is a computer program that allows a
	customer to order sandwiches for the 'Marsden Gourmet Sandwich Bar'
	It will be designed to allow customers to see the menu,
	make an order, review their orders, edit their orders,
	cancel their total order and proceed through a checkout.
	During the checkout process, the customer will have to select
	whether they want a pickup or delivery and enter their details
	appropriately. That is, customers who select pickup will only
	have to enter their name whereas customers who select a delivery
	will have to order their name, address, phone number. A delivery
	order will also incur a $3 delivery fee.
</p>

<!-- Factors Considered -->
<h2>Factors Considered</h2>
<p>There were numerous factors considered in the development of this program</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Agile process of project development through sprints</li>
	<li>Decomposing the program into smaller constituent functions</li>
	<li>Regular and comprehensive testing</li>
	<li>The management of a project backlog for prioritisation of tasks</li>
	<li>Regular commits to GitHub following the completion of sprints</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<!-- Project Management through GitHub -->
<h2>Project Management through GitHub</h2>
<p>Throughout the development of this program, I used GitHub for version control.
	In doing so, I was able to apply the Agile project management technique throughout the project.
	The Agile methodology involves breaking the project into smaller parts (displayed on a project backlog),
	developing a program by completing these short passages of work (called sprints) which accomplish
	tasks in order of priority, and continually reviewing completed sprints.
	The code associated with each sprint was tested on a separate Python file before being implemented
	into the main program, where it was tested again. Depending on what I had uncovered during the testing stage,
	I was then able to tailor the aims of the next sprint. Following the completion of each sprint, the version
	of the code was committed to GitHub. This meant that each version of the code was easily accessible throughout
	the process through GitHub. Furthermore, all the Kanban sprint boards and the overall project backlog are stored on GitHub.

<!-- Project Backlog -->
<h2>Project Backlog</h2>
<p>Throughout the process of developing this program,
	I had managed and referred back to a Project Backlog.
	The Project Backlog was set up as a Kanban board on GitHub
	and contained a list of tasks ordered by priority, with the
	tasks of highest priority at the top and those of lowest priority
	at the bottom. It was regularly updated (i.e. new items added,
	tasks reshuffled) throughout the project.
	The following image displays the status of my Project Backlog at the start.

<!-- Kanban Sprint Boards -->
<h2>Kanban Sprint Boards</h2>
<p>Prior to the development of each sprint, I created a Kanban Sprint Board on GitHub
	outlining the overall plan for that sprint. This enabled me to effectively manage
	the development of each individual sprint.

<!-- Sprint One -->
<h1 id="s1">Sprint One</h1>
		<hr>

		<!-- Aim -->
		<b>Aim</b>
		<p>In this sprint, I aim to create a basic program which can perform the following: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Display the menu (names and prices of each sandwich)</li>
			<li>Allow the customer to quit the program</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p>I also aim for it to contain an option menu for the two features,
			clear communication and a neat visual design. I would also like all
			inputs to be efficiently collected, especially in regard to
			case sensitivity</p>

		<br>

		<!-- Reflection -->
		<b>Reflection</b>
		<p>At this stage, the program successfully displays an option
			menu for two functions: one for printing the sandwich menu
			and another for exiting the program. It efficiently collects
			string and integer inputs in a way that is not case-sensitive
			and displays simple, clear feedback when required (e.g. it
			notifies the customer of when they enter an invalid input).
			Furthermore, whenever the customer enters an invalid input,
			they are given the option to enter that input repeatedly
			until the input entered is valid. It stores information
			about the sandwiches efficiently in a 2D (Multidimensional)
			list and makes clear separation of sections with horizontal
			rules for ease of use.</p>

		<p>However, there are still numerous areas for improvement.
			For example, the customer is unable to do anything else but
			view the menu and exit the program. Hence, my program could
			benefit from a greater number of features, the most important
			perhaps being for the customer to make sandwich orders
			(type and quantity) and to review their orders. I also realise
			that the current mechanism for printing the option menu is rather
			inefficient (printed as a single multi-line string), which makes
			it difficult to update. Hence, it may also be worthwhile to develop
			a more efficient method of printing the menu options (e.g. by
			creating a function which loops through a list).</p>

		<!-- Aim -->
		<b>Aim</b>
		<p>In this sprint, I aim to develop the sandwich ordering program
			so that it is capable of facilitating a greater range of features.
			In particular, I would like to integrate the following features</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An avenue for adding sandwiches to the 'cart'</li>
			<li>An avenue for reviewing all orders (sandwich type and quantity) in the 'cart'</li>
			<li>A more efficient method of printing the option menu (preferably another 2D list)</li>

		<br>

		<!-- Reflection -->

		<p>At this stage, the program successfully facilitates four basic features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Printing the Menu</li>
			<li>Placing an Order</li>
			<li>Reviewing All Orders</li>
			<li>Exiting the Program</li>
		</ul>

		<br>

		<p>Additionally, the mechanism for displaying the menu is significantly
			more efficient than in the previous version in that it is displayed
			by looping through a 2D list as opposed to printing a multi-line string.</p>

		<p>However, there are still numerous areas where there is potential for
			improvement. For example, there is a potential for a customer to order
			an unrealistic quantity of sandwiches (eg. 100,000). To avoid this,
			it would be beneficial for the program to impose a limit for the
			quantity of sandwiches ordered. Furthermore, it would be beneficial
			to extending the review feature of the program into a comprehensive
			checkout process, especially since the order review does not display
			the individual price or a total charge and does not account for a
			delivery fee (when appropriate). Furthermore, it would be good to
			incorporate a confirmation of orders and clear headings
			throughout the process.</p>

			<li>Displaying a more detailed review of the orders (e.g. further including individual prices beside quantities, a total charge and a delivery fee if appropriate)</li>
			<li>A confirmation of orders before proceeding with the checkout process which involves collecting customer details according to collection preference (see table below for details)</li>
			<li>Clear headings throughout the process</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Furthermore, I aim to set a limit of 5 sandwiches per type
			to prevent the customer from ordering unrealistic quantities
			of sandwiches (eg. 100,000). </p>

		<!-- Reflection -->
		<b>Reflection</b>
		<p>The program is now able to facilitate a more sophisticated checkout
			process, involving collecting the customer’s collection preference
			(e.g. pickup or delivery), a comprehensive receipt (including
			individual prices, quantities, a total charge and a delivery fee
			if appropriate), the confirmation of orders, an avenue for exiting
			the checkout process and clear headings throughout (e.g. STEP 1:
			PICKUP OR DELIVERY?, STEP 2: ENTER DETAILS). It also imposes a
			limit of five sandwiches for each order type.</p>

				<p>When the customer attempts to place an order, the Sandwich Menu, as well as an option to return to the Main Menu, is displayed.
				In this sprint, the mechanism for displaying this information was by looping through a 2D list (sandwich_list) and printing it, with the option of
				returning to the Main Menu being included in sandwich_list, while not actually a sandwich. This meant that when this information
				was displayed, 'X: Return to Main Menu : $-----" would be printed (i.e. with an unnecessary dollar sign) and that updating the sandwich menu
				would have been more troublesome. It also added unnecessary complications to the code such as in the feature 'Display Sandwich Menu'
				(where only the menu is displayed - no ordering) where no option to return to the Main Menu was necessary. In this case, printing out the sandwich menu
				needed an extra step of looping through all nested lists in sandwich_list except the last (which contained the option to return the to Main Menu)</p>

		<!-- Reflection -->
		<b>Reflection</b>
		<p>During the testing process for this sprint, I had encountered the following problem (which has consequently been resolved).</p>

		<p>The program would falsely categorise inputs with whitespaces between characters as invalid, even if they consisted entirely of letter characters (e.g. 'Happy St').
			As seen in the image below, I had run a test to identify what the program received, only to discover that the spaces had not been removed. This meant that when
			the program looped through each character in the input to check if it was a letter, it identified the whitespace, which was not a letter. After some inspection, I realised that
			this might have resulted from the fact that I had used the <code>.strip()</code> method to remove whitespaces (which only acts to remove leading and trailing
			whitespaces, not whitespaces between characters. To address this, I replaced the <code>.strip()</code> with <code>.replace(" ", "")</code>.</p>

<!-- Relevant Implications -->
<h1 id="ri"> Relevant Implications</h1>
<p>Relevant Implications are the possible effects or issues that may result from the creation of a digital product. There are
	three main relevant implications I have identified as pertinent for this program. These include sustainability and future proofing,
	functionality and usability.</p>

        <table>
        <tr>
			<!-- Sustainability and Future Proofing -->
			<th>Sustainability and Future Proofing</th>
			<th></th>
		</tr>
        <tr>
			<td>Description</td>
			<td>Addressal</td>
		</tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Future proofing refers to the ease at which a digital product can be updated and maintained.
				A digital product with a high degree of future proofing will possess a ‘modular’ structure, will follow
				widely-understood conventions, and will be easily understood and modifiable by others.</td>
            <td>The relevant implication of Sustainability and Future Proofing has been addressed in numerous ways throughout the program.
				<ul>
					<li>COMMENTING: Comments were integrated throughout the code. This ensures that if the code was to pass into the hands of another person, it would be more easily and quickly understood.</li>
					<br>
					<li>CODE CHECKING: The placement of the code through code checkers (e.g. PyCharm error checking system, codeWOF) was used to identify style errors (and then fix them). This was done to ensure that the code followed the conventions of the language and thus, would be more easily understood if passed to another person.</li>
					<br>
					<li>MODULAR STRUCTURE: The program was constructed with a modular structure (i.e. consisting of several small, constituent functions). This was done to ensure that new features can be both added (i.e. by creating new functions) and edited without having to alter any other pre-existing features. The compartmentalisation of the code into smaller units also makes it easier to comprehend.</li>
					<br>
					<li>DOCTYPES: DocTypes were integrated into each function, as well as to the top of the code, describing the purpose of each function and the code (respectively). DocTypes in functions also define the parameters of the function and their data types, which enables the person working on the code to quickly understand how each function acts.</li>

		</tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Functionality refers to the level of efficiency with which a digital product performs its function. A digital
				product with a high degree of functionality works properly. In particular, a program with high functionality
				will exhibit extensive validation, will perform calculations correctly and will not crash. </td>
            <td>The relevant implication of Functionality has been addressed in this program in two main ways:
				<ul>
					<li>TESTING: Throughout the development of this program, I had performed regular, comprehensive testing, which allowed me to identify errors and areas for improvement, which I then acted upon to improve the program's usability.</li>
					<br>
					<li>VALIDATION: All inputs have been validated so that the entering of invalid inputs will not result in a program crash, but will instead be met with a polite message requesting that the customer re-enters the input (which continues until a valid input is provided)</li>
				</ul>

        <tr>
			<!-- Usability -->
			<th>Usability</th>
			<th></th>
		</tr>
        <tr>
			<td>Description</td>
			<td>Addressal</td>
		</tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Usability refers to the degree of difficulty a user experiences during their interaction with a digital product. A digital
				product with a high degree of usability is ‘user-friendly’. It provides clear, appropriate feedback that is easily understood
				by the User, confirms the User’s actions, allows the User to gauge their current status and creates outputs
				that do not use complex or technical language.</td>
            <td>The relevant implication of Usability has been addressed in this program in several ways.
				<ul>
					<li>COMPARTMENTALISATION: Horizontal rules have been integrated throughout the program to achieve a degree of compartmentalisation. The objective with this was to ensure ease of use for the customer.</li>
					<br>
					<li>HEADINGS: Clear headings (e.g. "STEP 1: CONFIRM ORDER AND DETAILS") have been integrated throughout the program to ensure that the customer is always aware of where they are in a process.</li>
					<br>
					<li>PLAIN LANGUAGE: Plain, polite language (as opposed to complex or technical language) has been used throughout the program to ensure that communication with the customer is always clear and effective.</li>
					<br>
					<li>CONTINUOUS FEEDBACK: Each of the customer’s actions is met with clear and appropriate feedback (e.g. "ERROR: Invalid Input.") when an error has occurred, and a statement of confirmation for all customer actions (e.g."ACTION: All orders have been cancelled")</li>
					<br>
					<li>AVENUE TO 'EXIT': During the development of this program, I made a deliberate effort to ensure that a customer would always be provided with an avenue to ‘exit’ the process they are currently in and return to the main menu whenever they wish. </li>
