<!-- Overview -->
<hr>
<h1 id="o">Overview</h1>
<p>This python program is a computer program that allows a
	customer to order sandwiches for the 'Marsden Gourmet Sandwich Bar'
	It will be designed to allow customers to see the menu,
	make an order, review their orders, edit their orders,
	cancel their total order and proceed through a checkout.
	During the checkout process, the customer will have to select
	whether they want a pickup or delivery and enter their details
	appropriately. That is, customers who select pickup will only
	have to enter their name whereas customers who select a delivery
	will have to order their name, address, phone number. A delivery
	order will also incur a $3 delivery fee.
</p>

<!-- Factors Considered -->
<h2>Factors Considered</h2>
<p>There were numerous factors considered in the development of this program</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Agile process of project development through sprints</li>
	<li>Decomposing the program into smaller constituent functions</li>
	<li>Regular and comprehensive testing</li>
	<li>The management of a project backlog for prioritisation of tasks</li>
	<li>Regular commits to GitHub following the completion of sprints</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<!-- Project Management through GitHub -->
<h2>Project Management through GitHub</h2>
<p>Throughout the development of this program, I used GitHub for version control.
	In doing so, I was able to apply the Agile project management technique throughout the project.
	The Agile methodology involves breaking the project into smaller parts (displayed on a project backlog),
	developing a program by completing these short passages of work (called sprints) which accomplish
	tasks in order of priority, and continually reviewing completed sprints.
	The code associated with each sprint was tested on a separate Python file before being implemented
	into the main program, where it was tested again. Depending on what I had uncovered during the testing stage,
	I was then able to tailor the aims of the next sprint. Following the completion of each sprint, the version
	of the code was committed to Github. This meant that each version of the code was easily accessible throughout
	the process through GitHub. Furthermore, all the Kanban sprint boards and the overall project backlog are stored on GitHub.

<!-- Project Backlog -->
<h2>Initial Project Backlog</h2>
<p>Throughout the process of developing this program,
	I had managed and referred back to a Project Backlog.
	The Project Backlog was set up as a Kanban board on GitHub
	and contained a list of tasks ordered by priority, with the
	tasks of highest priority at the top and those of lowest priority
	at the bottom. It was regularly updated (ie. new items added,
	tasks reshuffled) throughout the project.
	The following image displays the status of my Project Backlog at the start.

<!-- Kanban Sprint Boards -->
<h2>Kanban Sprint Boards</h2>
<p>Prior to the development of each sprint, I created a Kanban Sprint Board on GitHub
	outlining the overall plan for that sprint. This enabled me to effectively manage
	the development of each individual sprint.

		<!-- Aim -->
		<b>Aim</b>
		<p>In this sprint, I aim to create a basic program which can perform the following: </p>
		<li>Display the menu (names and prices of each sandwich)</li>
		<li>Allow the customer to quit the program</li>
		<br>
		<p>I also aim for it to contain an option menu for the two features,
			clear communication and a neat visual design. I would also like all
			inputs to be efficiently collected, especially in regards to
			case sensitivity</p>

		<!-- Reflection -->
		<b>Reflection</b>
		<p>At this stage, the program successfully displays an option
			menu for two functions: one for printing the sandwich menu
			and another for exiting the program. It efficiently collects
			string and integer inputs in a way that is not case-sensitive
			and displays simple, clear feedback when required (eg. it
			notifies the customer of when they enter an invalid input).
			Furthermore, whenever the customer enters an invalid input,
			they are given the option to enter that input repeatedly
			until the input entered is valid. It stores information
			about the sandwiches efficiently in a 2D (Multidimensional)
			list and makes clear separation of sections with horizontal
			rules for ease of use.</p>

		</p>However, there are still numerous areas for improvement.
			For example, the customer is unable to do anything else but
			view the menu and exit the program. Hence, my program could
			benefit from a greater number of features, the most important
			perhaps being for the customer to make sandwich orders
			(type and quantity) and to review their orders. I also realise
			that the current mechanism for printing the option menu is rather
			inefficient (printed as a single multi-line string), which makes
			it difficult to update. Hence, it may also be worthwhile to develop
			a more efficient method of printing the menu options (eg. by
			creating a function which loops through a list).</p>

		<!-- Aim -->
		<b>Aim</b>
		<p>In this sprint, I aim to develop the sandwich ordering program
			so that it is capable of facilitating a greater range of features.
			In particular, I would like to integrate the following features</p>
		<li>An avenue for adding sandwiches to the 'cart'</li>
		<li>An avenue for reviewing all orders (sandwich type and quantity) in the 'cart'</li>
		<li>A more efficient method of printing the option menu (preferably another 2D list)</li>

            <td>Usability refers to the degree of difficulty a user experiences during their interaction with
				a digital product. A digital product with a high degree of usability is ‘user-friendly’. It
				provides clear, appropriate feedback that is easily understood by the User, prevents errors,
				confirms the User’s actions, allows the User to gauge their current status and creates outputs
				that do not use complex or technical language.</td>
            <td>The relevant implication of Usability has been addressed in this program in several ways.
				Firstly, clear headings such as ‘Order Review’ and ‘Order Menu’ have been integrated throughout
				the program to ensure that the User is always aware of where they are in a process. Furthermore,
				plain, polite language (as opposed to complex or technical language) has been used throughout the
				program. In response to all invalid inputs, the program issues a polite error message asking the
				user to reenter that input and in this process, often highlights the problem (eg. input does not
				fulfil the appropriate number of digits). Also, each of the User’s actions is met with appropriate
				feedback/confirmation and the User is always provided with an avenue to ‘exit’ any particular process
				and return to the main menu should they wish to. </td>
